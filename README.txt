Nerve Blocker teaches ultrasound interpretation for ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia. Currently, only the femoral nerve block is taught.

A precompiled version of the Android application can be found in the folder AndroidApplicationDownload. The appliction can be installed by downloading the app to an Android device. This can, for exampl, be accomplished by sending it to the device via e-mail.

The app can be compiled for both Android and iOS, provided the build computer has:
- gcc 4.8.1 or newer

In Arch Linux, these can be installed by following this commend:
